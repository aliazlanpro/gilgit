# Gilgit

Gilgit is a tool designed to translate complex search queries from PubMed or Ovid MEDLINE formats into various supported search engine formats.

This project is a fork of [Polyglot Search Translator](https://github.com/IEBH/sra-polyglot). It is currently under active development with the aim of converting the repository into a TypeScript package and publishing it to npm.
